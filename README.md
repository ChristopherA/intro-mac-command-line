Introduction to the Mac Command Line
====================================

This git repository contains a tutorial and associated files to introduce people to the Mac command line, with a focus on creating a base of skills that will make it easier for a novice programmer to learn web server and client programming skills, in particular JavaScript and Node.js.

* [Part 2 - Preparation and Installation](https://github.com/ChristopherA/intro-mac-command-line/blob/master/part2-prepare.md)

All of the installation and customization features suggested by this tutorial are also automated as part of a prepare-osx.sh script in [https://github.com/ChristopherA/prepare-osx-for-webdev](https://github.com/ChristopherA/prepare-osx-for-webdev), however, I recommend that you do the tutorial first to understand what this script does.
